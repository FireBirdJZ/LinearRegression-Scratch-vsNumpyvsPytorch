# LinearRegression-ScratchvsNumpyvsPytorch
All steps will have Matplot to visualize data
1. The project will make a simple Neural Network using the linear regression algorithm that runs on a Single Dataset. 
2. Then will add Numpy package to compare the implematation of scratch vs numpy. It will run on the same Dataset as the scratch implementation.
3. Lastly will add Pytorch, It will be the same as step 2 but having Pytorch and Numpy to to compare with.
